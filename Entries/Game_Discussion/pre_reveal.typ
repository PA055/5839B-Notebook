The reveal of the game made us think we could use some inspiration from the previous over-under season since it reuses a similar elevation endgame mechanic. We will need an intake a lot more than in over-under and it will need to elevate as well in order to reach all of the stakes effectively. It would also be best for the robot to be able be quick, especially because we want to gain control of as many mobile goals as we can. However, it could also be beneficial to be on the heavier side so we can guard the mobile goals in the positive modifer zones at the end.
