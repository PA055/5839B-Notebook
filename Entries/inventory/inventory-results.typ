After a week of work we were able to complete all rows of the spread sheet and figure out what parts the team was in need of. A variety of methods were used to measure the various parts. Large parts like Wheels and Motors were counted but other parts required a different aporach. String wires, and tubing were measured in feet, and metal strcuture by its weight. For parts like screws and nuts a single unit was weighed as well as the container and the total amount we had. The weight of the container was then subtracted from the total and then divided by the unit to find the total quanity.

We found our time managment to be extremely poor during this endevor which greatly increased its length. To adress this we may work to change how the team meets to allow for not only more time, but better uses of that time.
