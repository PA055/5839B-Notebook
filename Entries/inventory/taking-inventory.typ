Before any designing can take place it is key to know the constraints one is placed under. For vex a key way of doing this other then reading the rules is too see what parts are available to your team. You may have the best idea for a design but without hte parts to build that idea is jsut waisted time.In order to see what parts we had an excel spread sheet was created with all Vex Parts that were in our Inventor parts library as well as newer ones found the Vex website. Additionally Tools and other accesories from the Robosource website were included that we deemed may prove useful.

The Spreadsheet will take a while to fill out, but for now parts with known quanitities such as zero have been filled out. Those were marked with yellow to indicate more were needed. These were then taken to a second spreadsheet. This lays out all the parts and tools we want, their price, quanity, link to purchase, and priority. The priority is key as it allows us to make decisions on what to get within our budget.

admonition(type: "note")[
  Currently the budget is at zero as dues are yet to be collected and no fund raisers have been planned. It also improt to consider that a small percentage of the school's 15,000 dollar engineerign budget is randomly allocated to us so we will have that to work with.
