Odometry is a position tracking algorithim used by the coder to implement complex autons. It relies on three sensors 2 vertical and 1 horizantal. The failures of the previous design were compactness and resilliance and the new designs makes a few imrpovments to this area. It is important to complete this first as any protoype drives made must be designed to fit the sensors. This along with a basic mecnum drive which can act as a tank drive when need be will allow the coder to begin making some basic frameworks for next year. 

New Design:

- Verical Wheels save space by being in the same module

- No plate is used without being reinforced

- Pillow bearings used to simplfy mounting

- Newer 3.25in wheels used for better traction
